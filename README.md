# Vue todo code challenge
**vue-todos-code-challenge** is a code challenge for Vue.JS developers applying for a job at i22.

## Scenario
So here you are! You decided to apply for a job at i22 and now they are asking you to help them out.
Unfortunately we decided to create one more todo app which the world doesn't need and your task is to finish this one.

Our team was already able to complete the following:
* Add `axios` for REST api calls
* Add `vuex` and create a default store
* Add `vuetify` for UI components
* Add `vue-types` for prop validation
* Add the basic app and component structure

## Mission
- [ ] Fork this repository
- [ ] Create a named `vuex` module to hold your todos
- [ ] Complete the CRUD features in the GUI and make sure they are reflected in the store
- [ ] Make sure the `todo-list` component dynamically displays the todos
- [ ] Write concise commit messages
- [ ] Submit a merge request and describe your changes precisely

## Bonus
- [ ] Add [Vuex-ORM](https://vuex-orm.github.io/vuex-orm/)
- [ ] Add [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)

## Please note
- Pay attention to your code style and structure, don't ignore the eslint hints.
- Design your Vue components: use props, slots and whatever you need to keep your code clean.
- Display well in Google Chrome.
- Don't reinvent the wheel, use `vuetify` components when possible
- Don't test browsers except latest Google Chrome
- Don't pay special attention for responsive design

## Feel free to
- Improve the design to have better UI and UX.
- Re-organize the codebase.
- Use TypeScript.
- Create new modules/methods/components.
- Modify existing code.
- Add new packages.
- Edit `README.md` to add documentation.
- Fix potential bugs
