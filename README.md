# Vue todo code challenge
**vue-todos-code-challenge** is a code challenge for fullstack developers.

## Scenario
So here you are! You decided to apply for a job at i22 and now they are asking you to help them out.
Unfortunately we decided to create one more todo app which the world doesn't need and your task is to finish this one.

Our team was already able to complete the following:
* Add `axios` for REST api calls
* Add `vuex` and create a default store
* Add `vuetify` for UI components
* Add `vue-types` for prop validation
* Add the basic app and component structure

## Mission
- [ ] Connect the app to the given backend api (should be REST).
- [ ] Fetch all existing todos from the backend and display them in the frontend.
- [ ] Add a todo and submit it to the backend.
- [ ] Update the status of a todo, display the changed status in the frontend and submit it to the backend.
- [ ] Delete a todo and submit it to the backend.
- [ ] Use the Vuex store.
- [ ] Dynamically fill the Vue components with data
- [ ] Validate the props. Optional: use `vue-types`.
- [ ] Open a new branch for your changes and give it a good name.
- [ ] Write a nice commit message.
- [ ] Push your branch.

## Please note
- Pay attention to your code style and structure, don't ignore the eslint hints.
- Design your Vue components: use props, slots and whatever you need to keep your code clean.
- Display well in Google Chrome.
- Don't reinvent the wheel, use `vuetify` components when possible
- Don't test browsers except latest Google Chrome
- Don't pay special attention for responsive design

## Feel free to
- Improve the design to have better UI and UX.
- Re-organize the codebase.
- Create new modules/methods/components.
- Modify existing code.
- Add new packages.
- Edit `README.md` to add documentation.

## When in trouble
- We don't expect you to finish everything in one day.
- Focus on the *essentials*, do *bonus* only if there is time left.
- This task is not battle proven yet, there might be errors or missing documentation.
- Ask your colleagues, they are friendly.
- Also google is your friend.
